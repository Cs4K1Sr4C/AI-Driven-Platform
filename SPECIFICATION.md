# AI-Driven Platform Product Specification - PoC
\n\n## Problem\n\nReceiving new initiative requests from markets without sufficient data and information is a significant challenge. This often leads to developing solutions that on't address the actual problems, resulting in products that fail to drive value for the business or the consumers. Additionally, Product Managers (PMs)are struggling with the amount of time spent on administrative tasks, cluding writing epics, user stories, over-explaining details to the engineering team, and managing inefficiencies in capturing requirements during meetings.\n\n\n### Impact:\n\nThis leads to insufficient time for Product Managers to review KPIs, focus on strategic planning, and engage in value-added activities.\n\n### Examples:\n\n- "Not sufficient time for Product Managers to review KPIs due to meetings and monthly interactions."\n- "Product Managers overcompensate for other functions, taking over most responsibilities, leading to micromanaging every detail."\n- "Tooo much time spent writing user stories and tasks, keeping the team and over explain all details to the delivery team that are not captured during regular meetings."\n- "Problem definition from markets are missing, focusing on the how instead of the why.\n\n\n## Benefit Hypothesis\n\nWe believe that implementing an AI-driven platform for project management, which includes automated task creation, project monitoring and requirement capturing during discovery, will streamline our processes and improve efficiency.\n\nThis will result in product managers reporting a significant increase in the time available for reviewing KPIs, strategic planning and value-added activities.\n\n\nWe have succeeded when:\n\n- Project management costs have been reduced by 80%.\n
