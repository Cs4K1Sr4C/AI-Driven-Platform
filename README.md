# AI-Driven Platform Product Specification - PoC

## Problem
Receiving new initiative requests from markets without sufficient data and information is a significant challenge. This often leads to developing solutions that don't address the actual problems, resulting in products that fail to drive value for the business or the consumers. Additionally, Product Managers (PMs) are struggling with the amount of time spent on administrative tasks, including writing epics, user stories, over-explaining details to the engineering team, and managing inefficiencies in capturing requirements during meetings.

## Impact

This leads to insufficient time for Product Managers to review KPIs, focus on strategic planning and engage in value-added activities.

Examples:
- “Not sufficient time for Product Managers to review KPIs due to meetings and monthly interactions."
- “Product Managers overcompensate for other functions, taking over most responsibilities, leading to micromanaging every detail."
- “Too much time spent writing user stories and tasks, “babysitting” the team and over explain all details to the delivery team that are not captured during regular meetings."
- “Problem definition from markets are missing, focusing on the how instead of the why."
